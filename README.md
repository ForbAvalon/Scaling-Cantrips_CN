# Scaling-Cantrips
The forbidden act of bringing some D&amp;D 5e to a Pathfinder game

Specifically sets it up so that by default, cantrip damage spells (Acid Splash, Jolt, Ray of Frost, Divine Zap) get an additional 1d3 damage dice for every two caster levels a character has.
This caps out at 6d3 so it will just be under Magic Missile's max damage cap + be more likely to miss.

I mean that's before we get into later feats and stuff that wildly alters spells but that has also resulted in stuff like Bolstered Magic Missile being completely broken so eh.

You can adjust how many caster levels it takes + how high the max damage dice cap is, via the mod's Scaling.json it generates after first launch.

**How to install**

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0
2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous
3. Download the Scaling Cantrips mod
4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 5 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab

**Thanks**

Vek17 and their Tabletop Tweaks mod, couldn't understand how to actually do some of this stuff I couldn't dissect and take apart how your mod worked.
